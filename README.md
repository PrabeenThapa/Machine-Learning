# Numpy

>NumPy is a Python Package which stands for "Numerical Python".
>This was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant
>Using Numpy we can perform the following functionalities:

1. Mathematical and logical calculations on Array.
2. Fourier transforms and routine for shape manipulation.
3. It has built in functions for Linear Algebra, random number generation.
4. Used for scientific calculations.
5. It is faster than Python list.
6. It is fast because it is associated with c programming.

>NumPy is often called as an alternate for MatLab.
>NumPy is used with packages like SciPy and Mat-Plotlib.

>1 Dimensional Array is referred to as Vector.
>2 Dimensiona Array is referred to as Matrix.
>3 Dimensional Array is referred to as Tensor.

In this repository i will try to cover the topics of NumPy.
